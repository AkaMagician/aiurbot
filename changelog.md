- February 19, 2017

- January 25, 2017
  - 0.4.0 alpha
    - Changes
      - Separated some variables from index.js into a new file called coreOptions.js. If you do not have coreOptions.js, download it from the git repo and place it in the root folder along with index.js, then use a text editor to change the settings. This should make it a tiny bit more convenient to replace index.js when there is an update.
      - Seen user data will not save if the seen object is empty or null.
      - A soundcloud track will now be considered unavailable and autoskipped if the API response status code is 404.
